  "readme": "# nugget\n\nMinimalist command line downloader written in node, inspired by wget. HTTP GETs a file and streams it into a file in the current working directory. Specializes at downloading many files in parallel.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/nugget.png?global=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/nugget/)\n![dat](http://img.shields.io/badge/Development%20sponsored%20by-dat-green.svg?style=flat)\n[![Travis](http://img.shields.io/travis/maxogden/nugget.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/maxogden/nugget)\n\n## installation\n\n```\nnpm install nugget -g\n```\n\n## usage\n\n```\nnugget http://foo.com/bar.jpg\n# downloads bar.jpg and stores it in the current directory\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nnugget http://foo.com/bar.jpg -O baz.jpg\n# saves it as baz.jpg. you can also do lowercase -o\n```\n\nif you get a statusCode of 300 or greater nugget will stop. you can force it to stream the response into a file anyway by doing `nugget http://404link.com/file.html -f` or `--force` works too\n\nyou can also download multiple files, just pass multiple urls:\n\n![download multiple](multiple.png)\n\n## options\n\nThe following options are recognized by nugget:\n\n * `-s|--sockets` - default Infinity. specify the number of http sockets to use at once (this controls concurrency)\n * `-o|-O|--out` - specify the filename to write to. this only works if you are downloading a single file\n * `-d|--dir` - save files in a directory other than the current one.\n * `-c|--continue` - resume downloads if a partially complete target file already exists. If the target file exists and is the same size as the remote file, nothing will be done.\n * `-f|--force` - force the server response to be saved to the target file, even if it's a non-successful status code.\n * `--no-strict-ssl` - disable strict ssl\n * `--proxy` - specify a proxy to use\n",
